# PathFinding-Visualizer
This project helps to visualize the Dijkstra's Algorithm which is considered the father of the Pathfinding Algorithms.   

Dijkstra's algorithm gurantees the shortest path between two or more nodes. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance between the source node and all other nodes.  

Many famous applications and games, including Google Maps, use this algorithm due to its effeciency. It has a time complexity of O(V2) but with min priority queue it's time complexity drops to O(V + ElogV)

# How to use the Application
You can easily visualize how the algorithm works by pressing the Visualize button.

You can draw walls by clicking and dragging across the grid to make it a bit harder for the algorithm and can clearly see how easily Dijkstra's pierces through even the most complex mazes with ease while guranteeing the shortest path!
